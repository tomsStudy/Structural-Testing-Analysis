# Strucutral-Testing-Analysis

A set of scripts created to help process the results of structural testing at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch New Zealand.

  * Some of the documents such as UDL import are specific to the University of Canterbury logging systems.
  * Most of the other scripts are general and can be used on any type of data.
  * Primarily focused on timber connection testing at this stage, although most of the code can be used for any type of force displacement or stress strain input.
